== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=How to set up a new APP in Mautic to get connection keys?=

Please refer to the APP setup section of the connect tab in our Mautic Integration plugin. You will find a link to the APP setup and from there you can follow the steps to set up a new APP in Mautic.

[You can also visit this app setup guide to learn how to set up a new app and get the connection keys](https://docs.makewebbetter.com/mautic-woocommerce-integration-app-setup-guide/)

=Getting problems in creating Mautic custom fields. What should I do?=

From the last few responses from our users/clients, we came to know of this common issue “Something went wrong, Please try again later!” while creating the custom fields in Mautic. This could be because of Mautic configuration and permission setup on the server. But we’ve just come up with a solution for this.

 **Please follow the steps to get rid of this:**

i) One of the “annotations” folders on Mautic should be writable in order to make custom fields. Please navigate to the folder where the Mautic has been set up and follow this path:

 **For Mautic Version 2.x**
path -to-mautic/app/cache/prod/ and make the annotation file writable. Set the permission as 777.

 **For Mautic Version 3.x**
path -to-mautic/var/cache/prod/ and make the annotation file writable. Set the permission as 777.

ii) After this, clear the Mautic cache.

There are several ways to do that. The easiest is by going to the /app/cache folder and delete its content or you can also rename the cache folder like cache_backup

You can also check out this guide to resolve the cache troubleshooting issue.

=What should I do? I can’t see the API Credentials section in Mautic.=

If your Mautic doesn’t show up in the API Credentials section inside the menu then please make sure that API is enabled in your Mautic account. The same can be achieved from Settings > Configuration > API Settings. Please mark the API enabled checkbox to “YES” and your Mautic account will be enabled for API.

You can also visit this app setup guide for the Mautic setup and learn how to get the connection key.

=Why is the Mautic Integration plugin not getting redirected back and showing some Mautic error?=

Please make sure you are using the correct Mautic base URL and connection keys for authorization. Make sure that the redirect URI set in Mautic APP is the same as your WordPress URL (or you can copy the Redirect URI from the APP setup guide directly).

=I've completed the setup process but real-time user data is not syncing properly in Mautic. Why?=

Please make sure you have completed the fields set up for the plugin. We have two methods for syncing the data over Mautic.

 **Real-time Sync:** You need to select the Instant Sync option in Plugin > Setting Tab > General Setting. Select the Instant Sync option and click Save. Then your Contacts will sync instantly. You can test the sync by creating a test user in your admin.

 **Every 5 minutes:**  Synchronization will be done every 5 minutes so make sure that you wait for that much time. Also please assure the WordPress Cron is enabled on your site and works properly. Go to Plugin > Settings > General Setting option and select In Every 5 Minutes Sync option and click Save.

=I am new to Mautic. How can I get Mautic to download?=

Mautic is an open-source CRM and can be easily downloaded from Mautic.org.

=How to add specific tags to contacts in Mautic?=

Go to your WordPress Dashboard > Mautic > Settings. In the General settings, you’ll find a feature named custom tags. You can add your tags to this provided field.

=The Mautic Integration Plugin is disconnected from Mautic and shows the notice of re-authorization. How can I fix it?=

The connection is lost when the Mautic refresh token is Expires. You only need to change the Access token lifetime i.e 3600 or more and Refresh token lifetime i.e 365 days.

To do this, login to Mautic, click on Setting Tab on the right top corner. Now go to Configuration > API Settings. You’ll find the settings to change the access and refresh token lifetime.

You can also check our APP setup guide to learn how to do it.
